Subject: Interested?

Hi,
We are looking for a smart guy with extraordinary hacking skills.
Our mutual friend assured us that you are our men.

TL;DR: We are observing a group of terrorists that are planning something.
We have intercepted some data, but do not know how to read it (attached).

Somewhere there is a password. We have to find it to stop terrorists.
Would you like to join our team? Help us and we will help you in future.

It’s not clear how to start. Our flink told us that the key is somehow related with three key phrases: `guns`, `and`, `roses`. Probably these are names of some messages.
Would you check if you have access to any of them?

If you want to help, please type:
`frequon(subject = "Re: Interested?", content = "Text of the message that you have access to")`
so as we could read the message too.

Remember: any time you want, you can get some piece of advice, just
type: `frequon(hint=TRUE)`.

Subject: Frequencies

We are so glad you want to help us!

Thank you for the message, it looks interesting... However, this text
is to long to be one password we are seeking. This must be some coded
message, if only we could know the key...

But let`s take a look, the `p` letter appears very often. And
`i` does`t. In english language letter `e` would occures
most often. If we would know how often each letter is used in
the message, we could compare them with known english
letter frequencies! So let`s to this!

We are going to prepare data about frequencies of letters
in english, so if you could find the frequencies in the messages,
that would be awesome (to trzeba zmienic :P).

Send us reply: `frequon(subject = "Re: Frequencies", content = `freq`)` as soon as you
will finish. `freq` is the vector of frequencies for each letter.
Please, remember to name this vector with respective letters!

Subject: Transcription

Great job! Now, when we know which letters are used most often
and which are the least common, we can combine them with known
english frequencies of letters. We have prepared and attached
the `EnglishLetterFrequency` dataset. It contains relative
frequencies of letters in the english language.

Now you can substitute old ciphered letters with the new
english letters. Can you show us your results?

Send us reply: `frequon(subject = "Re: Transcription", content = "textyouwillget")`.
We wish you luck!

Best regards!

Subject: Key

Well done! Now we are so close! Our message looks a little bit familiar,
there are even some words we know. But there are also still words,
looking strange. It means that our key is not fully
correct, and we need to investigate these letters, that were
mistranslated.

There is one idea how to do this.

Zliczmy wszystkie wyrazy, te, które pojawiają się najczęściej sa dla nas łatwe do
poprawienia. Te które pojawiają się najrzadziej być może są łatwo rozpoznawalnymi
rzeczownikami?

Take advantage of `top100commonWords`.

Type:
`frequon( subject="Re: Key", content=c(old = "abcdef....z", new = "newlettersrespectively"))`
where `old` are the letters in the code`s sense and `new` are fitted real letters.

Subject: Next text

Excellent work, you have cracked the code!

However there is no password in here.
There must be some clue in this message...

What do you think about possibility that our friend used the key
to ciphere the names of two remaining messages?
Would you have access to them now?

Please, send us reply:
`frequon(subject = "Re: Next text: X",
          content = "Content of the unlocked message")`

where "X" is the name of that message you are able to unlock.

We would be grateful.

Subject: Lengths in the text

Obviously this message is also ciphered. We tried to use the key
but turns out it was written in some language we unfortunatelly don`t know.
Can you recognize the langague?

Don`t worry, we know some simple idea how to recognize the language of the any
ciphered message. All you need to do is to measure the length of each word. If we would
know how many words has the length of 1, 2, 3, and so on, we could compare
them with the lengths of words in languages that we know! Naturally we need some
huge amount of words in plenty languages. It`s just as well we have a sample from
wikipedia resources, so we can share it with you.
Please, find the `wikiquotes` attachment. There is a list of quotes for many languages.
We hope this is enough for our needs.

This is huge job to measure the length of each word for all languages, but we believe
you know some fast way to (.... coś byle nie do this).

Send us your results:
`frequon(subject="Re: Lengths in the text", content = `lengths`, attachment = `wiki_lengths`)`.
`lengths` is the vector of tabeled length of all words.
`wiki_lengths` is the list of tabeled length of all words for each language.
Please, remember to name this list with respective languages!

Thanks to this data we would be able to prepare couple barplots to conclude about
the similarities between distribution of the lengths in our message and known languages.

Subject: Language in the message

Well done! Thanks to your results we obtain excellent barplots (you can probably
also see them in your magic program :P). Now we can investigate
what the language was used to prepare the second message.
How do you think: which from the all distributions is most similar to
the distribution of the lengths in our message?

Send us your thoughts! Type
`frequon(subject = "Re: Language in and message", content = "Language")`
where "Language" is the name of the right language.

Subject: You are the champion!

## TASK: hint1

Firstly, try to answer the following questions:
  * Does R treat "A" and "a" as the same letter?
  * Is "word" and "word," the same word for R?

The functions like: "tolower()/toupper()", "gsub()" might be useful to handle these issues. Consider replacing all non-alphanumeric
characters with empty strings ("").
The easiest way to deal with this kind of problem is to use regex. String: "[^a-z ]" allows you to extract all non-letter charaters
with spaces.

Finally familiarize yourself with "strsplit()" and "table()" to count all of the letters easily.
The `letters` R-object may also be very helpful for the problem.

To see which letters occure the most frequently use `sort()`.

## TASK: hint2

Manual subsitution may by pretty demanding. This is why you may appreciate a `chartr()` function :) Remember to convert all
letters to lowercases.

## TASK: hint4

All you need to do is split the whole text by spaces and table all created words. Do you remember how `strsplit()` function works?

If you do this, try to put old letters in alphabetical order.

## TASK: hint5

Remember that if we have `old` as ciphered letters and `new` as real ones, we need to find real letters in `new` and seek for their
translation in the `old` character string.

## TASK: hint6

There is a very useful function in R to measure number of characters in words. Take advantage of `nchar()` function. Remember to split
the string into single words with `strsplit()` as you probably did before. To check the length of each word correctly pay attention to
all comas and dots! Is the length of "dots." and "dots" the same? `gsub()` function with "[^a-z ]" regex may be helpful here (only if
you convert your text to lowercase!).

Do the same thing with all of the elements of the `wikiquotes` list. You may use `for` loop or even `lapply` function to do this
easier and faster!

## TASK: hint7

Compare distributions using `barplot()` function for counted lengths of words in the message and counted lengths of words in all
languages.

## TASK: errorIntro

We were looking so long for somebody like you who could
help us solve this mistery. If you don`t have access to the
messages, than we wiil have to ask someone else :(

## TASK: errorNAs

Nice try, but there is one or more missing values (NAs) in the given vector.
Replace all the NAs and then try to pass the vector again.

## TASK: errorFrequencies

There is something wrong with the given frequencies... Have you converted the text to
lowercase? Are you sure you did this properly?

## TASK: errorNoNAMES

The vector that you passed does not contain names. Please, pass named vector.

## TASK: errorLetters

You did not pass frequencies for all of the letters :(

## TASK: errorDecipher

This translation seems not to fit to the `roses`.
Did you sort `freq` vector correctly before translation?

## TASK: errorKey1

We don't understand the `key` value in the given form. Type again the key you found in the
following form: c(old = 'oldlettersabcd...z', new = 'newlettersrespectively')

## TASK: errorKey2

Don`t you think that both lengths of `old` and `new` should be equal to 26?
This is the number of all letters in the Latin alphabet.

Please, correct this mistake and try again.

## TASK: errorBadKey

Nice try. However, this key does not translate the message correctly.
Are you sure that everything is all right?

## TASK: errorBadX

(? I don't understand what the author meant) According to the first our remaining messages are named "guns" and "and".
This is why X should be one of these names.

## TASK: errorBadX2

Have you really unlocked the "guns" message?

## TASK: errorBadAND

We can not open the message. Try again. Maybe you sent a bad file?

## TASK: errorWikiNames

Names of attachment are incorrect. Please, send us `lengths` with names according
to `wikiquotes` names.

## TASK: errorLengths

There is something wrong with the way you count the lengths of the words in the message
or the `wikiqoutes` file. Please, try again.

## TASK: errorLanguage

We don`t think that this is the right answer. The language you suggested doesn`t fit
our message.

## TASK: errorEnd

We are afraid this is not the password that we are looking for. Are you sure there is nothing
else to see?

## TASK: errorAttachment

It seems that you might have forgotten to attach files. Please, send this message
with the attachement.

## TASK: errorContent

Did you send this message without content?

## TASK: errorSubject

Do You Want to Send This Message Without the Subject?
